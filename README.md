# Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)** algorithm in Python. HHO is a **nature-inspired, swarm-based metaheuristic** that simulates the cooperative hunting behavior of Harris hawks.

The project contains **two modules**:

1. **Continuous Optimization Demo** – Shows how HHO works step by step (Sphere function)  
2. **Engineering Optimization Example** – Applies HHO to a simple real-world problem (minimizing fuel consumption)

These modules illustrate both **the working mechanism of HHO** and **its optimization performance in practice**.
